> Automation scripts for fetching email messages from Gmail API ðŸŽ£

Gmail Fisher allows you to query email messages that you have in your Gmail inbox.

![Script demo](docs/script-running-demo.gif)

Some of these automation tasks are used for fetching email receipts from certain purchases made online,
scrapping email subjects, bodies and attachments; and mapping them to Expense objects, to serialize them
into `.json` files.

Some existing adapters include fetching food expenses from UberEats or Bolt Food, or transportation
expenses from Uber and Bolt.

Follows an example of the JSON output for such expenses:

```json
[
    {
        "service": "Bolt Food",
        "restaurant": "Hello Beijing",
        "total_euros": 11.8,
        "date": "2023-02-14",
        "sender_email": "Bolt Food <portugal-food@bolt.eu>"
    },
    {
        "service": "Bolt Food",
        "restaurant": "Poke House",
        "total_euros": 14.29,
        "date": "2023-02-11",
        "sender_email": "Bolt Food <portugal-food@bolt.eu>"
    },
    {
        "service": "Bolt Food",
        "restaurant": "DOTE",
        "total_euros": 13.34,
        "date": "2023-02-08",
        "sender_email": "Bolt Food <portugal-food@bolt.eu>"
    }
]
```

## Getting Started

Go to [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), 
and under `APIs and services` > `Credentials`, create a new `OAuth 2.0 Client ID` credential.

Under `Actions`, click `Download OAuth client` and then `Download Json`.

Rename downloaded file to `credentials.json` and place it under the `auth` folder.

## Run Scripts

### Export Food Expenses to JSON

Filters available messages with Uber Eats and Bolt Food expenses.

Scraps data from those messages to populate a `FoodExpense` iterable that will then be serialized to a Json file.

Example:
```bash
poetry run export_food_expenses --output-filepath='output/food_expenses.json'
```

### Export Transportation Expenses to JSON

Filters available messages with Bolt expenses.

Scraps data from those messages to populate a `BoltTransportationExpense` iterable that will then be serialized to a Json file.

Example:
```bash
poetry run export_transport_expenses --output-filepath='output/transport_expenses.json'
```

### List Messages

Filters available messages with `KEYWORDS` and from `SENDER_EMAILS` and lists them.

Example:
```bash
poetry run list_messages --sender-email='portugal-food@bolt.eu' --keywords='Delivery'
```

### Save Attachments

Filters available messages with `KEYWORDS` and from `SENDER_EMAILS` and lists them.

If filtered messages contain attachments, then those will be downloaded
to an `output` directory and with a formatted name of `PaySlip_YYYY-MM.pdf`.

Example:
```bash
poetry run save_attachments --sender-email='me@my-company.com|payroll@my-company.com' --keywords='payslip'
```
